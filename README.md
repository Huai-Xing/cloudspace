# Cloudspace

An all-in-one workspace that acts as a channel for users to contribute to environmental efforts, in collaboration with NParks.

## Motivation

It is getting harder to keep up with our hectic lifestyles with endless tasks and deadlines at hand, and it doesn't help that increasing connectivity is generating more distractions and procrastination. Moreover, the use of a physical workspace results in the use of large amounts of paper and related products, which is detrimental to our environment. Statistics have shown that almost 600,000 trees are being cut down daily just to product paper and related products!

## Aim
Hence, Cloudspace leverages environmental efforts as incentives to encourage users to be more productive. This accessible and convenient workspace allows users to contribute actively to the environment while managing their tasks efficiently.
